### URL patterns
**Root (/):** This shows the landing page of the app, it introduces the concept of the app and has a carousel showing main functionalities.
**Calendar View (/home/calendar):** This is the main page of the app, where users see all their events showing one a calendar.
**Search (/search):** This page shows the search result of calendars. 
**Subscribe (/subscribe):** This page is where users have options to subscribe to more calendars.
**Events table (/total_events):** This refers to a list of events this user has.

**Calendar Routes:**
- Route: */calendars* - /calendars refers to a list of calendars this user has.
- Methods: *#index*, *#create*
  - #index shows the calendars.
  - #create allows the user to create a new calendar; it renders /new.
- Sub-routes on /calendar: */new*, */:index* 
  - /:invite_token refers to the specific calendar.
  - Methods on /:invite_token - *#show*, *#update*, *#destroy*
    - #show shows the current calendar.
    - #update updates the current calendar.
    - #destroy deletes the current calendar.
  - Sub-route on /:invite_token - /edit, which changes the settings on the current calendar.

**UserCalendar Routes:**
- Route: */user_calendars* - /calendars refers to a list of calendars with users.
- Methods: *#index*, *#create*, *#subscribe*
  - #index shows the user calendars.
  - #create allows the user to create a new user calendar;
  - #subscribe allows the user to subscribe to another calendar in the database; it renders /subscribe_calendar
- Sub-routes on /user_calendars: */new*, */:index*

**Event Routes**
- Routes: */events*, */holidays*, */class_periods*, */courses*, */assignments*
  - All of these have the same methods, but are different types of event.
- Methods on these routes: *#new*
  - #new makes a new event of the specified type, it renders /new.

- Routes: */calendars/:calendar_invite_token/other_events*, */calendars/:calendar_invite_token/holidays*, */calendars/:calendar_invite_token/class_periods*, */calendars/:calendar_invite_token/courses*, */assignments*
- Sub-routes for these routes: */:slug*

  - Method on /:slug - *#show*, *#update*, *#destroy*
    - #show shows the specific event.
    - #update updates the specific event.

  - Sub-route on /:slug - */edit*: This allows a user to edit the event.
  
**Sign-up/Login Routes**
- Routes: */users*, */signup*, */login*, */logout*
    - /signup creates a new User and allows a user to sign up for the service. It uses the method users#new.
    - /login creates a new session and logs in the user. It uses sessions#new and sessions#create to do this.
    - /logout closes the session and logs out the user via sessions#destroy.

### Instruction to run test
We incorporated system tests as well (see how to run below) but unfortunately we kept get errors and the number of errors and failures would vary each time we ran it, without changing anything. It seems to be a race condition of some sort. Anyway, we did write them and met with TA but alas, were not able to solve this issue in time.
```
rails test
rails test:system test
```
